# Welcome to Milton Team 5060's Wiki!
This wiki is a guide to teach members how to program the robot for [FTC Competitions](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc).  

The FTC People say we shall use Android apps and phones to control the robots since the 2016 competition.  We use Java for this. Or Block Programming, if you're familiar with Scratch.

This is the [official code](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app) that they post. They tell us to use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) to build our Android apps.

We made a copy of the [official code](https://github.com/MiltonStatic5060/ftc_app) (totally legal!) and we have our own simple-ish ways of building our Android apps.

Btw, the original documentation, the javadoc, is available [here](https://miltonstatic5060.github.io/5060-tutorials/index.html) in case you wanted the original stuff.
