# Can I Join Robot Club?
We ABSOLUTELY take anybody who's willing to join and learn how to make a robot.  Only requirements we have are: alive, human, in grades 9-12, and somehow present at Milton High School in Milton, MA, USA.  We officially meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays, although we'd like to meet everyday when possible.  We'll say when we meet on extra days.

If you already know how to make a robot then it would be great if you could teach us something too.
3D Printing skills may be used and/or taught in this club.

# Who Runs The Club?

Robot has three parts.   
A body.  
Some motors.  
A brain.  

Bodies and motors can be replaced.  
One does not easily replace a brain.  
This is why programmers are in charge.  

---
Programmers are builders who do the complicated parts.  Wiring the robot, setting it up and organizing its functions are imperative to the job of programmer.

Builders are actually meant to do the grunt work of building the bulk of the robot.

One who cannot understand how the whole robot functions (programming) cannot dictate how the club should be run or how the robot should be built.

# Which Programming Style Should I Use?

Don't use block programming.  The Block programs can only be used for this one club, only when in the club, and only when one has the robot that stays in the club.  Block programs can't be modified anywhere else, not without a lot of hard work.

Use Java. Java can be anywhere, any computer: Linux, Windows, or Mac.  Java programming can be setup anywhere and can be modified anywhere.  No robot required.  Setup may be a lot of work, but no click and drag means faster writing. Java programs can also be made to span multiple files and super complex robot commands can be made, quickly and easily.

So learn the hard way to program the robot, and don't use the blocks.  Unless you can't handle the hard way then go to your blocks programming. (People in the real world don't use code blocks)
