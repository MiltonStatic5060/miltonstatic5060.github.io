# For Normal Programmers (Can be done on any computer)
Maybe learn Java first, but you don't need to (we'll try to cover that)
- [https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java)  
- [https://www.sololearn.com/](https://www.sololearn.com/)  
- [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/)  

**Download and install** [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)  
Windowsx86 is 32-bit. Do it if you don't know what bit you have.

**Download a code editor.** Microsoft Word or Notepad won't cut it.  
-[Atom](https://atom.io/)  
-[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)  
-[Brackets](http://brackets.io/)  

**Download the project files.**  
[ftc_app zip file](https://github.com/MiltonStatic5060/ftc_app/archive/master.zip)  
or  
clone our [ftc_app git repo](https://github.com/MiltonStatic5060/ftc_app)  

**You now have the tools for either:**  
[Our Robot Crash Course](https://github.com/MiltonStatic5060/5060-tutorials/wiki/Writing-Code#top)  
or  
[Our Java Crash Course](https://github.com/MiltonStatic5060/5060-tutorials/wiki/How-To-Java)

# For Block Programmers (Must be setup at the club first)
(kinda like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/))

**Get two Android Phones from the club room. (we'll need to make sure they're good phones)**  
Install [this apk application](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/releases/download/v3.1_fixed/FtcRobotController-release.apk) on the phone.  
Install [this apk app]() on the other one.

**Get the robot.**

**Now:**
